# let's other mods check whether this mod is currently enabled
# to prevent errors in your mod when checking whether my trigger returns "yes", create a file that starts with '00000_' and add is_historicinvasions_active = { always = no }

# so, in summary:
	# '00000_': effects that are supposed to be easily overwritten
	# 'zzzzz_': effects that are supposed to take priority at all costs

is_historicinvasions_active = { always = yes }
