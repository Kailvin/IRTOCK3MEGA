As a result, lots of [old_culture.GetName] [old_faith.GetAdjective] people have begun settling in the newly conquered areas.\n\nThe distance between [GetTitleByKey('k_oghuz_il').GetBaseNameNoTier] - the land of our distant ancestors - and our new home in [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetName] is large and my people are bound to diverge ever so slightly as time goes on.\n\nWill we break the mold of our roots or cling to our old traditions?"

 seljuk_invasion.1001.desc:0 "Not too long ago, an $turkish$ clan leader named Seljuk split off from his bretheren in $d_aral_il$ and set out for the lands in $k_syr_darya$, specifically to the town of Jand. He was not unheard of, as he had served in the $khazar$ horde before. Once a believer in Tengri, he converted to Sunni Islam in 985 and died 24 years later in the town he had migrated to.\n\nJust a few years ago, the Seljuk tribe migrated second time: from the plains in $k_syr_darya$ to $d_gurgan$ and rented grazing fields in exchange for mercenary services. During the tumultuous Persian Intermezzo period, they eventually acquired land as a vassal under the $e_ghaznavid$ before eventually overpowering them.\n\nThe rise of the Ghaznavids wasn't able to end the Persian Intermezzo period, but perhaps the fractured region will soon be ruled whole again?"
