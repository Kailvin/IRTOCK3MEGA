 bassenheim_invasion.1001.desc:0 "The Teutonic Order was founded during the height of the crusades: Their origins can be traced back to 1191, when a group of German merchants from Bremen and Lübeck set up a hospital during the ongoing siege of Acre. In 1198, they were turned from a hospice brotherhood into a military order by decree of Pope Clement III in order to defend Jerusalem from the surrounding Muslim forces. [invader.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] Walpot von [invader.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip], also known as #italic Henry Walpot#!, was declared to be its first Grand Master.\n\nOver the coming years, the order would receive several castles in the Levant, Holy Roman Empire, Transylvania and even Thessalonika as gifts.\n\nThe Orders of Dobrzyń #weak (~35 knights, est. 1228)#! and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword #weak (Schwertbrüderorden, est. 1202)#! were integrated into the Teutonic Order in 1234 and 1237 respectively.\nThe integration of the former resulted in their very first foothold in the Baltic region and would also prove to be their most permanent seat of power.\nThe latter brought with it large amounts of holdings in Terra Mariana #weak ('Land of Mary'; Livonia and Estonia)#! and would from now on be known as the Livonian Order.\n\nBacked by religious zeal - and most importantly the Holy Roman Emperor as well as the Papacy - the order would continue expanding in Prussia until 1283. The construction of Marienburg Castle was started in 1274. During its livespan, the Teutonic State #weak (Ordenstaat)#! would engage in several trade disputes with the Republic of Novgorod and the Hansa.\n\nThe order achieved its main goal of proselytizing the Baltics when Lithuania christianizatized in 1387. Though this did not automatically put an end to the Baltic Teutonic State, it would go hand in hand with its decline: In 1410, during the battle of Tannenberg #weak (or Grunwald / Žalgiris)#!, the order was decisively defeated by Polish and Lithuanian forces, which resulted in them losing control over Terra Mariana - and the Livonian Order emerging as a de facto independent entity.\nIn 1525, they entered vassalage under Poland, henceforth being referred to as 'Ducal Prussia'. It then fell under a personal union with Brandenburg in 1618 and by 1701, it was fully integrated into the Kingdom #bold in#! Prussia."
