 zunbil_invasion.1001.desc:0 "Back in 680, [rutbil_zunbil.GetFirstNameRegnal] became the first [invader.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip] ruler of $d_zabulistan$ when [barhatakin_zunbil.GetSheHe] broke off from the Hephthalite $kingdom$ ruled by his younger brother [tegin_nandin.GetFirstNameRegnal].\n\nFrom 698 onwards, the [invader.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip]s fiercely resisted $islam_religion_adherent$ excursions into central Asia and avoided paying tribute on several occasions.\n\nThe [invader.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip]s are also mentioned in Chinese sources written by the $han$ Tang dynasty. In their records, they note how the $heritage_turkic_name$ people of $d_zabulistan$ were defending their land from the Arab invaders. Around this time, $d_zabulistan_adj$ art can be seen to include Chinese influences as well.\n\nThough they were able to resist outside invaders for over 200 years, their realm would finally fall to [laith_al-saffar.GetFirstNameRegnal] in 870 and bring an end to the worship of [GetFaithByKey('zun_pagan').HighGodName] in the region.\nThe remaining central Asian realms would continue to resist further eastward expansion until they were subjugated by [GetTitleByKey('e_ghaznavid').GetName] in 1026.\n\nWill [invader.GetShortUIName] be able to reconquer [invader.GetHerHis] dynastic claims to the region and restore @zunist_icon! [GetFaithByKey('zun_pagan').GetAdjective] worship?"
