 bm_632_islam_desc:0 "On the 8th of June, 632 AD, the Prophet Muhammed passed away, having spread the nascent religion of Islam across much of the Arabian peninsula through his efforts at amassing a great following. With his death, Abd Allah ibn Abi Quhafa (commonly known as Abu Bakr) succeeds him as the first of the Rashidun caliphs, uniting Arabia under one leader and one faith.\n\nThe rapid consolidation of power in Arabia comes at an inopportune time for the Roman and Sassanian Empires -- both of whom were reeling from a two decade-long conflict that ended four years prior. With both empires vulnerable and the Prophet's own calls for their monarchs to convert to Islam, the Rashidun Caliphate readies itself for war.\n\n#bold Will Allah guide the faithful towards victory, or will the Sword of Islam remain buried in the sands of Arabia?#!"
