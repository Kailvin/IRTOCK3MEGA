 COCHINEAL_GLOSS: "In the modern era, #bold Cochineal#! typically refers to #italic Dactylopius coccus#!, a scale insect native to the Americas, whose larvae was harvested to produce red dye; the term is also used for the red dye itself. However, before the Columbian exchange, Polish Cochineal (#italic Porphyrophora polonica#!) and Armenian Cochineal (#italic Porphyrophora hamelii#!) were two important insect species used in the production of red dye; they were native to parts of Eastern Europe and the Armenian highlands respectively. In the case of Polish Cochineal, after the ancient Slavs developed a method of obtaining this dye, it became one of Eastern Europe's chief exports until the 1500s when it was supplanted by American Cochineal which was cheaper."
 FERN_FLOWER_GLOSS: "The #bold fern flower#! is a magic flower that features in Baltic and Slavic mythology. In real life, ferns are not flowering plants, so a fern flower does not exist per se; however, there are flowering plants that resemble ferns. Regardless, this flower is said to bloom for a short time during summer solstice, and it is said to grant its finder miraculous powers, though for this reason it is jealously guarded by powerful spirits."
