 SHURTA_GLOSS: "In modern Arabic, #bold shurta#! typically refers to the police or some sort of local authorities. However, during the early Islamic period, while the shurta could similarly refer to some sort of security or police force, they could be tasked with other duties depending on time and place, such as espionage, judicial functions, tax collection, garbage collection, acting as bodyguards for governors, supervising prisons, and enforcing morality laws."
