As one emperor is a child under a regency led by Flavius Stilicho and the other is seen as weak and easily manipulated, this bodes poorly for the divided empire . . . \n\nDespite their father's efforts, Honorius and Arcadius are forced to contend with the last remnants of paganism across the two empires, while foreign entities like the Huns and Sassanids compete for dominance against the Roman world. The Franks look toward expanding further into Gallia, while the Visigoths seek retribution for years of grievances committed by the Romans. \n\n#bold Playing as the sons of the late Theodosius, how will you guide the Western and Eastern Roman Empires?#!"

South Arabia was greener and wetter in those times than it is today, and the dam captured the periodic monsoon rains that fell on the nearby mountains to water the area around the Sabaean capital, Ma'rib. The dam was maintained and damaged several times throughout history. In 145 BC, it was breached during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Saba. The resulting flooding ruined crops and triggered a mass exodus of people in search of sustenance. Subsequent damage to the dam in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD witnessed the further and definitive dispersal of the population."

After a number of exchanges Emperor Li decided to have Shi stripped of his titles and ordered his sons and brother killed. Shi sent for aid from the Khitan Khagan Yarüd Ñaugu, promising the Sixteen Prefectures if they would support him as Emperor.\n\n#bold The stage is set, and the combined armies of Shi and Khitan march against the Later Tang.

Adat represents a secular moral code, distinct from religious laws. It encompasses strict guidelines, some of which as spesific as which direction to face while pouring a drink or what kind of hat one is allowed to wear. More broadly, it emphasizes respect for elders, courage, and above all, honesty. Those who violate Adat laws are exiled from society, along with anyone who continues to associate with them. In earlier times, it had been associated with the Caucasian traditional religions, but later Caucasians adhering to Abrahamic religions kept following it as a secular code, some even saw it as a supplementary guide on how to enter heaven."

Our warriors outnumber theirs and our wrath shall destroy their armies and burn their cities! We must rise up and fight for our freedom and what we and our children deserve!"\n\nAfter my speech, I look at the crowd that has formed around me. Slowly they start chanting:\n\n"King of the Goths!

 TFE_gladiator_events.0009.desc: "Whether through bad luck or poor design, some spectator stands collapsed. Fortunately, you were in an adjacent stand, but some others were not so lucky.

It is clear that before help arrives the house of cards will collapse on the fighter, killing them."
 TFE_gladiator_events.0004.desc: "Caesar had a naval battle staged as part of his quadruple triumph while dictator, followed by Augustus and other emperors who wished to emphasize the grandiosity of their reign.

I have prepared dozens of boats and thousands of rowers and slaves. The fighters only await my signal."

The trainer sees me and pauses the training, ambling over while jerking his thumb at the two fighters taking a breather.\n Like what you see? For a small sum, you can buy yourself a well-trained fighter."
 TFE_gladiator_events.0006.desc: "After a fruitless period spent tossing and turning in bed, you step outside for a quick walk in the crisp night air, hoping it will clear your head. Suddenly, a bell starts ringing, followed by the sound of baying dogs and guards on the hunt. As you turn a corner, you collide with a shadowy, cloaked figure, sending both of you sprawling on the ground. You reach out to help the other to their feet, but as you do so, a posse of watchmen and their guard dogs come hurtling down the street, pausing and regarding the pair of you with suspicion. Their leader steps forward and asks if I have seen an escaped slave from the gladiator ranks anywhere, his eyes lingering on my companion. I spot a glint of armor underneath the cloak. Could this figure be their quarry?"

 tradition_xabze_desc: "Xabze is a set of unwritten laws that every Circassian and Abkhazian is expected to follow. It regulates every part of life with many guidelines, some of which as spesific as how one should style facial hair based on marital status or who they should be next to while walking, depending on the age and gender of the others. More broadly, it emphasizes respect for elders, courage, and above all, honesty. Boys and girls are raised with horses and weapons from a young age. Those who violate Xabze are exiled from society, along with anyone who continues to associate with them. In earlier times, it had been associated with the Circassian traditional religion, but later Circassians adhering to Abrahamic religions kept following it as a secular code, some even saw it as a supplementary guide on how to enter heaven."

Since then, Hadrian's Wall had been bereft of any meaningful garrison and has now served as little more than a landmark for any raid coming from the highlands of Pictland.\n\nFrom across the North Sea, the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians continuously pillage the coast and bring with them settlers to populate their newly-conquered lands in the British Isles. In the west, the remaining Celts of Hibernia eye our lands with devious intent and already some raids from them have begun anew. With the Western Roman Empire in sharp decline, Britannia is now little more than a battleground fought over between different peoples, cultures, and faiths. Whoever overcomes all challenges the British Isles bring forth will surely lead the region in a new direction.\n\n"

According to legend, his father, Hujr, disapproved of his son's hedonistic lifestyle and love of poetry, wine, and women, and banished him from his kingdom. Yet when the tribe of Asad killed his father, he renounced wine and women to fight and slay many of the Asad in revenge. He then wandered the Middle East, supposedly as far as Constantinople, to find supporters to help him reclaim his birthright.\n\n#bold As a poet, your words will inspire Arabs for generations.

To assauge your doubts, you can offer Belisarius a clear choice -- remain in Africa as a governor, or return to the capital for an Imperial Triumph and reassignment to another post. The time to test his loyalty is now."

 TFE_descendants_of_li_ling_desc: "This nomad clan is not like other nomad clans. They are unique in claiming descent from the Han general Li Ling, himself a descendant of the fearsome "Flying General" Li Guang. Li Ling was forced to serve the Xiongnu after losing to them in battle and never returned to his homeland, and has become a legendary if controversial, tragic hero of both the steppe tribes and in China. It is said that he carried a deep sorrow in his heart, one still carried by his descendants."

Most importantly, the situation on the mainland has forced the Roman government in Mediolanum to focus on the defense of the Rhine and the Danube, leaving Britannia largely vulnerable and undefended.

With several Christian figures already condemning the new emperor as an apostate, Julian's reign is already in a tenuous position. \n\n#bold Harkoning to a nearly-bygone era, will Julian succeed in restoring Hellenic Paganism to its place of prominence and stabilize the Roman Empire once more?"

The Eastern Romans followed suit in establishing the Tanukhids and Jafnids as tributary states, and now set their eyes on the independent kingdoms of the Caucasus Mountains. Another contender in the region, the Axumites, look to dominate Himyar along the opposite shores of the Red Sea.\n\n#bold The riches of the Near East have brought two great empires and several outlying kingdoms into a centuries-long struggle.
