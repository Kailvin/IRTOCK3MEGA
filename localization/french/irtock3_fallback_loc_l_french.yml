The Roman Empire was divided into two, with Honorius inheriting the West and Arcadius inheriting the East. As one emperor is a child under a regency led by Flavius Stilicho and the other is seen as weak and easily manipulated, this bodes poorly for the divided empire . . . \n\nDespite their father's efforts, Honorius and Arcadius are forced to contend with the last remnants of paganism across the two empires, while foreign entities like the Huns and Sassanids compete for dominance against the Roman world. The Franks look toward expanding further into Gallia, while the Visigoths seek retribution for years of grievances committed by the Romans. \n\n#bold Playing as the sons of the late Theodosius, how will you guide the Western and Eastern Roman Empires?#!"

 building_marib_dam_01_desc: "A marvel of ancient engineering, the Great Dam of Ma'rib may date back as far as 1,700 BC, with the final version completed in the 8th century BC by the prosperous Kingdom of Saba. South Arabia was greener and wetter in those times than it is today, and the dam captured the periodic monsoon rains that fell on the nearby mountains to water the area around the Sabaean capital, Ma'rib. The dam was maintained and damaged several times throughout history. In 145 BC, it was breached during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Saba. The resulting flooding ruined crops and triggered a mass exodus of people in search of sustenance. Subsequent damage to the dam in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD witnessed the further and definitive dispersal of the population."

Once united under the banner of the Roman aquila, Western Europe is now divided among competing Germanic kingdoms, and the final Western Roman outposts in Soissons and Illyria had been subdued by their neighbors; only the Eastern Roman Empire stands as the last bastion of the glory of Rome. \n\nFive years have now passed since Flavius Petrus Sabbatius ascended to the purple as Imperator Iustinianus I. In the short time he has ruled over the empire from Constantinople, he revised Roman law in its entirety through the #italic Corpus Juris Civilis#!, quashed the Nika Riots, and repelled a Sassanid assault on his eastern border - particularly with the military genius of his general, Flavius Belisarius. \n\n#bold Iustinianus has long dreamed of restoring Roman rule to the west, and is now intent on dispatching Belisarius to lead the reconquest of the former Western Roman Empire. Will the aquila fly over Italia, Africa, and Hispania, or will it remain dormant in the east?"

Ever since the usurper Magnus Maximus launched his bid for imperial power, Britannia had been stripped of not only a sizeable portion of its garrison, but also any sort of armed band that could protect her, along with many governors and the flower of its youth. Since then, Hadrian's Wall had been bereft of any meaningful garrison and has now served as little more than a landmark for any raid coming from the highlands of Pictland.\n\nFrom across the North Sea, the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians continuously pillage the coast and bring with them settlers to populate their newly-conquered lands in the British Isles. In the west, the remaining Celts of Hibernia eye our lands with devious intent and already some raids from them have begun anew. With the Western Roman Empire in sharp decline, Britannia is now little more than a battleground fought over between different peoples, cultures, and faiths. Whoever overcomes all challenges the British Isles bring forth will surely lead the region in a new direction.\n\n"

 disaster.0012.desc: "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! Concerning reports from the countryside have arrived. After years of pristine high yields, agricultural laborers in Latium apparently lost all output. According to their missive, an outbreak of fever has decimated the population after an onset of floods inflicted damage to their fields. Our steward suspects that their stupidity led them to skip fallow rotation. As a consequence, there is neither any able laborer nor any suitable land to work on anymore; everything lies in ruins and a response is needed to alleviate the crisis."
 disaster.0010.desc: "During this year a most dread portent took place, for the sun gave forth its light without brightness like the moon during this whole year. It seemed like the sun was in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear and from the time when this thing happened, men were neither free from war nor pestilence nor any other thing leading to death."
 disaster.0011.desc: "Today, in the middle of the night, the earth herself trembled. The aftermath was devastating. Reports of houses collapsing on unsuspecting families and fires breaking out throughout the lands of Latium have come piling in. Homes, marketplaces, and places of worship that were once sturdy and proud are now in complete ruins. Even the walls of the great Colosseum in Rome have not gone unscathed... This desolation has left countless wounded, homeless or dead."

Most importantly, the situation on the mainland has forced the Roman government in Mediolanum to focus on the defense of the Rhine and the Danube, leaving Britannia largely vulnerable and undefended. As Roman dominion over Britannia turns to ash, what could be a better time for us to carve out a new homeland along these white cliffs, within these dense forests, and among the temples and palaces of Camulodunum and Londinium?"
