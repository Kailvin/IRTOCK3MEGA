This did however secure [invader.GetHerHis] position as [invader.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l].\n\nAs part of this treaty, $arab$ armies were forbidden from traveling through the tributary state, future [invader.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l]s would be nominated by the Emperor and religious converts would not be persecuted."
