South Arabia was greener and wetter in those times than it is today, and the dam captured the periodic monsoon rains that fell on the nearby mountains to water the area around the Sabaean capital, Ma'rib. The dam was maintained and damaged several times throughout history. In 145 BC, it was breached during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Saba. The resulting flooding ruined crops and triggered a mass exodus of people in search of sustenance. Subsequent damage to the dam in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD witnessed the further and definitive dispersal of the population."

 tradition_adat_desc: "Adat is the umbrella term for a series of unwritten cultural norms in the Caucasus. There are specific variants, such as Xabze in Circassia, Akabza in Abkhazia, Nokhchalla in Chechnya, Lezgival in Lezgia, and Ghabzala in Dargia, among others. Adat represents a secular moral code, distinct from religious laws. It encompasses strict guidelines, some of which as spesific as which direction to face while pouring a drink or what kind of hat one is allowed to wear. More broadly, it emphasizes respect for elders, courage, and above all, honesty. Those who violate Adat laws are exiled from society, along with anyone who continues to associate with them. In earlier times, it had been associated with the Caucasian traditional religions, but later Caucasians adhering to Abrahamic religions kept following it as a secular code, some even saw it as a supplementary guide on how to enter heaven."

He has reestablished Annam as Jinghai Jun, fortifying it against any future invasion.\n\nPrior to this, Nan Chao had sent Burmese horse raiders east into the Irrawaddy Valley, defeating the Pyu city-states that once dominated the region. Those lands now lie ripe for the picking, and the lord of Pagan may be a useful ally if you choose to seize them for yourself, or perhaps even the divided tribes to the south.\n\nAt home, the recent influx of Buddhist monks from India has presented a unique opportunity. Until now, Nan Chao has been a decentralized hierarchy of clans and tribes. However, these new Buddhist ways of thinking, along with the bureaucratic ideas of Tang, may be the road to consolidating your hold over the tribes. With some time, it may be possible to cast aside the ways of old and enforce your absolute rule over all of Nan Chao.\n\nMany paths lie open for you, U Shiei Lung. Which will you take?"

 TFE_gladiator_events.0008.desc: "You're feeling extra adventurous around mealtime today, and so you wander around until you happen upon the local marketplace -- stands in a plaza surrounded by shops. Vendors are here hawking all sorts of produce, items, and other products of note. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot --"
 TFE_gladiator_events.0009.desc: "Whether through bad luck or poor design, some spectator stands collapsed. Fortunately, you were in an adjacent stand, but some others were not so lucky. As you survey the wreckage, you spot a gladiator with a broken leg trapped underneath a pile of precariously balanced beams. With a groan, the residual structure shudders. It is clear that before help arrives the house of cards will collapse on the fighter, killing them."
 TFE_gladiator_events.0004.desc: "Caesar had a naval battle staged as part of his quadruple triumph while dictator, followed by Augustus and other emperors who wished to emphasize the grandiosity of their reign. As in the past, a basin has been dug near a river and filled with water, with an island in the center for spectators like myself to sit. I have prepared dozens of boats and thousands of rowers and slaves. The fighters only await my signal."
 TFE_gladiator_events.0005.desc: "As I'm hurrying down an alleyway from my lodgings to the arena one day, I'm distracted by the sound of a series of quick sword strikes. I round the corner and see a local ludus (gladiator school). In the courtyard, a furious fight is occurring between a secutor (shortsword and shield) and a retiarus (trident and net). The trainer sees me and pauses the training, ambling over while jerking his thumb at the two fighters taking a breather.\n Like what you see? For a small sum, you can buy yourself a well-trained fighter."
 TFE_gladiator_events.0006.desc: "After a fruitless period spent tossing and turning in bed, you step outside for a quick walk in the crisp night air, hoping it will clear your head. Suddenly, a bell starts ringing, followed by the sound of baying dogs and guards on the hunt. As you turn a corner, you collide with a shadowy, cloaked figure, sending both of you sprawling on the ground. You reach out to help the other to their feet, but as you do so, a posse of watchmen and their guard dogs come hurtling down the street, pausing and regarding the pair of you with suspicion. Their leader steps forward and asks if I have seen an escaped slave from the gladiator ranks anywhere, his eyes lingering on my companion. I spot a glint of armor underneath the cloak. Could this figure be their quarry?"
 TFE_gladiator_events.0007.desc: "After an exciting day filled with gladiator fights, I decide to find a local tavern to relax for the rest of the night. As I enter, I survey my options. I should..."

More broadly, it emphasizes respect for elders, courage, and above all, honesty. Boys and girls are raised with horses and weapons from a young age. Those who violate Xabze are exiled from society, along with anyone who continues to associate with them. In earlier times, it had been associated with the Circassian traditional religion, but later Circassians adhering to Abrahamic religions kept following it as a secular code, some even saw it as a supplementary guide on how to enter heaven."

 britannia_struggle.0501.desc: "Over the past few decades, the Roman Province of Britannia has become an increasingly isolated part of the empire. Ever since the usurper Magnus Maximus launched his bid for imperial power, Britannia had been stripped of not only a sizeable portion of its garrison, but also any sort of armed band that could protect her, along with many governors and the flower of its youth. Since then, Hadrian's Wall had been bereft of any meaningful garrison and has now served as little more than a landmark for any raid coming from the highlands of Pictland.\n\nFrom across the North Sea, the Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Frisians continuously pillage the coast and bring with them settlers to populate their newly-conquered lands in the British Isles. In the west, the remaining Celts of Hibernia eye our lands with devious intent and already some raids from them have begun anew. With the Western Roman Empire in sharp decline, Britannia is now little more than a battleground fought over between different peoples, cultures, and faiths. Whoever overcomes all challenges the British Isles bring forth will surely lead the region in a new direction.\n\n"

Then, suddenly, everyone saw a manifestation of Belenus, god of the sun and healing, appear in the sky!\n\nAs it looked like this great deity was defending the city from the air, this was a source of great encouragement to the guards, who were able to turn the tide of battle and force the bandits to retreat. For many years afterwards, the village was never bothered by bandits."

No one comes to Elephantine these days, save for occasional wanderers or a few suspected blasphemers sympathetic to Khnum.\n\nIt is time we formally close the Temples of Elephantine, and demonstrate the superiority of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith. The structures are too large to destroy, so we’ll let them be and forbid any heretical worship from taking place here."

As a final blow, their lands have now fallen in our hands. The land left by them is perfectly ready to be settled by our loyal subjects. The Circassian tribe living North of the Kuban, the Kabardians, have no doubt the worst land out of all Circassians, nothing but harsh and infertile soil, with looming threat of nomadic raids.

Though the simplest Yakhchals were storage pits dug into the ground, more complex variations were dome-shaped structures that were built above ground. They were engineered to utilize the physics of evaporative cooling and radiative cooling to maintain a low temperature. Yakhchals were used frequently by Iranians of all social classes, particularly in more arid climates, well into the 20th century to provide cooled food and drink, such as sorbets and chilled wine. For instance, a 19th century German traveler, Ernst Hoeltzer, mentioned how even the poor used Yakhchal to store water, and people could buy ice in the bazaar or straight from a Yakhchal."

Even the frontier [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_liang').GetName] has not been immune to the chaos of the times.\n\nThe Former Liang dynasty, which ruled Liang nominally in the name of the Jin, is long gone.

This is not done randomly, but based on a code that only a few people know, and if it is discovered, the code is modified. Thus, enemy armies and spies, even if they speak Circassian as their native tongue, would have no way of understanding our intentions.

Founded by Makkhali Gosala, the Ajivikas believed in the concept of determinism, asserting that everything in the universe, including human actions, is predestined and beyond individual control. They adhered to the principle of niyati, which states that each being's fate is predetermined from birth to death. The Ajivikas practiced strict asceticism, renouncing worldly pleasures and focusing on rigorous self-discipline and meditation."
