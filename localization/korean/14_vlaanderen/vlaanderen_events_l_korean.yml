The City of the World's Desire itself is aflame while the Latins are doing unthinkable things to the local population.\n\nThe former ruler of the $e_byzantium$ has fled the city and left $b_constantinople$ in the hands of [latin_emperor.GetShortUINameNoTooltip], who has proclaimed [latin_emperor.GetHerselfHimself] rightful ruler.\n\nAcross the strait, [nikaea_emperor.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] has organized a resistance to reclaim the lost city and restore the $e_byzantium$."

 vlaanderen_invasion.1103.desc:0 "A surprisingly small number of crusaders has gathered around the ports in $c_venezia$. Many have instead chosen to treat the upcoming Great Holy War as a pilgrimage and are now wandering towards $c_jerusalem$ on foot. There are in fact so few knighs waiting in $c_venezia$ that a large portion of the built vessels will remain unused.\n\nThis does not concern the waiting crusaders though. They are eager to set sail and take part in a Holy Cause.\n\nTheir ships won't head directly towads $c_jerusalem$ though. The $e_byzantium$ has promised to provide the crusaders with a steady stream of supply, which they are going to pick up first."

Worse yet, the knights have started to set up camp in front of the city and are threatening to breach the Theodosian Walls!
