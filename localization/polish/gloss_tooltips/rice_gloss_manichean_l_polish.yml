 ELECT_GLOSS: "The #bold Elect#! were members of the Manichean Church who functioned as clergy, having taken strict vows to eschew sinful acts, and to dedicate their lives to liberating the Light through prayer, ritual, and other religious actions. They were not allowed to harvest or prepare their own food, and could only eat one meal a day; this meal was an important ceremony where, through the act of consuming vegetarian meals, they could free the Light from the dark world of Matter. Although Manicheism probably did not have a monastic tradition initially, Manichean members of the Elect in eastern regions like Central Asia and China likely adopted a monastic lifestyle due to the influence of Buddhism."
 HEARER_GLOSS: "The #bold Hearers#! were the lay members of the Manichean Church. Though they did not have to follow the strict vows of the Elect, the Manichean clergy, they still had their own set of vows to follow to avoid sin. They were also required to engage in various fasting days and in a weekly ceremony to confess their sins. Additionally, they were encouraged to do 'soul-service' by supporting the Elect through alms and other forms of donations."
 ZINDIQ_GLOSS: "Though later used to indicate heretics in general, medieval Muslims originally used the term #bold Zindiq#! to  refer to followers of the Manichean religion."
 DINAVARIYA_GLOSS: "The #bold dinavariya#! was a Persian term, derived from the Middle Persian word 'denawar,' originally used by the Manicheans to refer to the Elect, members of the Manichean clergy. Over time, however, the Manicheans of the Iranian world and Central Asia began to use the word to self-identify themselves, as opposed to their western Manichean brethren. There was even a 6th or 7th century schism within the Manichean Church where schismastics in Transoxania, known as dinavariya, disputed the authority of the Manichean religious leadership in Babylon and criticized western Manicheans for their religious laxity. It would be incorrect to assume that dinavariya itself was an actual heresy, however, as the term likely predated the schism, and continued to be used for many more centuries.."
 MANICHEAN_PARINIRVANA_GLOSS: "In Manicheism, #bold Parinirvana#! has a different meaning than in Buddhism, which the term was derived from, due to Manicheans' propensity to assimilate other religions' vocabulary to spread their teachings. Buddhist parinirvana refers to the final passing away of a Buddha or other being who has attained nirvana, whereupon their physical existence ends and they have liberated themselves from the cycle of birth and rebirth. Manichean parinirvana, however, refers to the death and martyrdom of the Prophet Mani, which also is compared to the Passion of Jesus."
