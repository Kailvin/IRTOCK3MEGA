 JATAKA_GLOSS: "The #bold Jataka#! are a body of Buddhist tales originating from India that tell of various stories, mostly relating to the Buddha's previous lives, where he could be anything from a powerful god or king to a lowly animal like a monkey or insect. In these stories, the Buddha's previous self resolves the problems facing the characters to bring a happy ending, imparting some sort of moral lesson or aesop relating to Buddhist doctrine, particularly in regards to karma, the cycle of suffering, and rebirth. The jataka stories have been popular subjects of art and other literature throughout the centuries in Buddhist societies."
