 VIRAGO_GLOSS: "#bold Virago#! is a Latin term historically in Europe used to refer to a woman who possessed masculine virtues. Though it implied a trangression of cultural gender norms, it historically was applied to women who acted heroically and rising above their station, such as those who fought bravely in war (like Joan of Arc), or a holy woman renowned for her exemplary religious practice and devotion. However, it could also have a pejorative implication, to indicate an overbearing woman, for instance; in the modern day, the term tends to be used in this latter sense."
