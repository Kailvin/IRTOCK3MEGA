Its mountainous terrain and cold climate are harsh on its inhabitans - only the strongest manage to survive.\n\nOn this fateful day, a son was born to a $mongol$ chieftain while clutching a clot of blood in his hand. Some have interpreted this as an omen and expect him to become a great warrior later in life."

What followed was an adventurous life as [invader.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and his family members got abducted or imprisoned on multiple occasions as an act of revenge by neighboring tribes. [invader.GetSheHe|U] would later serve as a vassal under Toghrul.\n\nFollowing [invader.GetHerHis] proclamation as Khan of the $mongol_collective_noun$ by [invader.GetHerHis] followers, [invader.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and his close friend Jamukha clashed in battle in which [invader.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was soundly defeated. Some claim that he was exiled and served under the Jin dynasty until he returned to the steppe around 1195.\n\nHaving learned much as a servant under the Jin, [invader.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] went on to defeat and subdue [invader.GetHerHis] rivals one by one, until [invader.GetSheHe] was the sole ruler of $e_mongolia$. [invader.GetSheHe|U] has just held a Kurultai at the Onon river where he was proclaimed 'Genghis Khan' - Universal Ruler.\nIs that just a hopeful dream or will the $mongol_collective_noun$ eventually subjugate the whole world?"
