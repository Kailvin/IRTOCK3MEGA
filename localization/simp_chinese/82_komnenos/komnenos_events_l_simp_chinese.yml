 komnenos_invasion.history_intro:0 "Ever since the battle of [GetTitleByKey('b_manzikert').GetNameNoTier] in 1071, the $e_byzantium_adj$ grasp on Anatolia had steadily been declining. Due to further lost battles and failed diplomacy, the empire finally lost control over most of the region by 1086 to the $hi_dynn_oghuz_house_seljuk$ Turks.\n\nEven though the capital of the empire, the city of [GetTitleByKey('b_constantinople').GetNameNoTier], was mostly located on the Balkan side of the Bosphoros strait, the empire's heart was actually located to its east along the Aegean coast.\nCompared to Anatolia, the mountainous Balkans were sparsely developed and the home of rebellious Slavs. The loss of Asia's expansive terrain, helleinzed population and arable land presented a huge loss for the empire, which relied heavily on collecting land tax. Additionally, losing control of Anatolia meant that the empire no longer had access to a buffer zone to shield its Aegean cities from Arab and Turkic raids, even after the reconquest of the Anatolian coastline led by emperor Aléxios Komnēnós in the later quarter of the 11th century.\n\nIn 730 to 787 and 814 to 843, the $iconoclast_adj$ controvery shook the Christian world, as religious icons were either demolished or melted down as worshippers feared God's wrath after experiencing natural disasters or military failures.\n\n"
