After its downfall, [invader.GetHouse.GetName] was first subjugated by the Jalayirid Sultanate ruling from $c_baghdad$, then by $timur_timurid_character_template_name$.\nAfter $timur_timurid_character_template_name$'s death in 1405, the tribe initially expanded south towards $c_baghdad$ before also seizing land all the way to $d_shirvan$.\n\nTheir newly build realm would start declining just a handful of years later due to numerous raids by $timur_timurid_character_template_name$'s' descendants, failed conquests against their rival $hi_dynn_oghuz_house_aq_qoyunlu$ as well as unruly vassals.\n\nThey claim to be descendant from the legendary [invader.GetDynasty.GetName] Khan through the $hi_dynn_oghuz_house_yiwa$ tribe."
